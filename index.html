<h2>How does internet work</h2>
<span>Just like people talking to each other using a particular language,</span>
<span>computers talk to each other using their language. The most popular language is HTML.</span>
<span>HTML stands for <em>hyper text markup language.</em></span>
<span> When I want to visit google, i enter the web address www.google.com into my browser</span>
<span>Now my browser will send an HTTP request to the service provider and the service provider will find the server that holds the information</span>
<span>The server then sends back a HTML document to the browser</span>
<span>The browser will now interprets the data and displays on my computer.</span>
<span> in this case when i wanted to look for <a href=www.google.com> google,</a></span>
<span> google servers provides me with the informations.</span>
<p>
  <b>Tags and eliments</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  HTML contents consist of HTML elements, and these elements consist of other tags and attributes.<br>
  <span> this is how the browser know s what to do with the HTML document.</span>
<span> Using all these together the computer could display any content.</span>

</p>
<p>
  <b>What is Void tag</b><br>
  <br>
<span>Void tags are basically the tags that does'nt have any content in it. So when using void tags we dont have to specifically mark the beginning and the end of those tags.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b> Inline or Block elements</b><br>
  <br>
  <span>HTML contents are either inline or block elements.</span>
  <span> this is used to mark the content inside the elements</span>
